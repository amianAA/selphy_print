These '.bin' are either 3D LUTs or Heat Tables for various HiTi 
printers.  All files were extracted from public HiTi source code or 
binary driver releases.

LUT filename Codes:

 C M Q P ? ra [ .bin ]
           --  model code, see below
         -     media version, 0..n (if not present, interpret as 0)
       -       alwayx P (or 'CL')
     -         print quality, Q == fine, P == normal
   -           media type, M == DNP, C == CHC         (?)
 -             Always C
            
  model codes:

    ra = P51x
    rd = P72x
    rh = P75x
    ri = P52x
    si = P11x

Heat table codes:

 hea 0 q c ra [.bin]
           -- model code, see above
         -    media type, h == DNP, c == CHC      (?)
       -      print quality, q == fine, t == normal, (or p == ?)
     -        media version, 0..n (or 't')
  ---         always 'hea'
